# MNAddDocumentImages

This Plugin adds the 200x200 Thumbnails to each product in the documents. Please note, this is only a test, because you can already access the images without this plugin. You can use the variable {$position.image} in the documents/index.tpl to get the article images. The core functionality uses {$position.meta.image.thumbnails.0.source} for the same thumbnail size.
